  <p class="aboutText"><strong>Hi Im Jackson Ford</strong> On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind
    Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its
    origin would be the word (and) and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.</p>
  <p class="aboutText">Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost
    unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the
    far World of Grammar.</p>
